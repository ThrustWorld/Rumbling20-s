<h1>Rumbling 20's</h1>

Rumbling 20's is a game projected with C# and Unity during the Global Game Jam 2020. </br>
<b>What's the Global Game Jam?</b> The GJJ is a hackathon where you have to create a game in less than 3 days with a main topic given when the game jam starts. If you wanna know more about it, click [here](https://globalgamejam.org/about). </br>
The team was composed by 6 members: 3 software developers, 2 game designers, 1 2D/3D artist. </br>
The game has been thought to be played on Ipad, so the screen is vertical. </br>
Furthermore, it has been my first game jam and my first game using Unity. Due to this, I created an updated and completed version of the game; you can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/ThrustWorld/Rumbling20-s-Remake) and on [Itch.io](https://thrustworld.itch.io/rumbling-20s-remake). </br>

<h3>Commands</h3>
Input: Mouse(LeftClick) --> Going to the left / Mouse(RightClick) --> Going to the right. </br>     
Exit the game: ALT + F4.
